    "clustering, statistical inference, and data visualization in order to extract conclusions from structured and unsctructured data\n",
    "##### What is the difference between structured and unstructured data\n",
    ">structured data is rows and columns which include fields with a meaning. Like a database in SQL, which is easy to handle\n",
    ">unstructured data is a native format of data, which comes in rows with different length, and different meaning, no fields, like a music file or an image. This data is handled only when it is processed\n",
    "##### what is exploratory data analysis\n",
    ">exploratory data analysis is the action taken after the raw data was cleaned and organized, then comes the analysis of the data so that from this action we can get reports, visualisation and communication\n",
    "##### what are the two targets achieved by data science\n",
    ">2 targets are addressed with data science in companies: 1. making decisions based on the exploration of data 2. solving problems that arise in day to day business\n",
